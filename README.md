# Hi there 👋 I am Himanshu Goel.

## I am a 👔👨🏻‍💻 Full-stack Developer.

### I like to work on 💻 Web stuff (HTML, CSS, JS), 🅰️ Angular, Typescript, Jasmine, Node JS, etc.

### I also love 🤗 to playing computer games, attending technical trainings, listening to music and watching movies.

## Over the past 10 years,

I've worked in different companies on different roles, ranging from .Net developer to Angular Node JS developer.

Right now, I am working as Sr. Developer at [Sopra Banking Software](https://www.soprabanking.com/), crafting their suit of products for a global customer-base to provide fast, reliable and robust solutions. Mainly I am working on Angular, Typescript, Jasmine and Node JS here and I love what I do here.

Before that, I was working with [Citibank](https://www.citigroup.com/citi/), [Deutsche Bank](https://www.deutschebank.co.in/) and [Synechron](https://www.synechron.com/) as Full Stack Developer mainly in BFSI domain ranging from Policy, Insurance, Risk to Savings and Mortgage management applications.

I am always excited for the challenge of learning new technologies. In this line of work, it's very easy to get caught up in the technical side of things, but what really drives me is the way that code can impact people. Software doesn’t exist in a vacuum, and the choices we make as developers could mean the difference between a user having a really good day or having a really frustrating day – it’s this that motivates me to make my work the best it can be.
